# Palm Plant Store

This is my final project for Code Kentucky's Web Dev 2 course. It is a website for a fictional houseplant store named Palm. Per project requirements, it is a mobile-first, responsive website containing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an integrated third-party API.

## Additional Features:
  1. A regular expression was used to validate user input and informs the user about it:
      * The email form will alert the user if an email address is valid or invalid. Also, if the user attempts to submit the form without entering an email address, an error message will alert the user.

  2. A light measurement converter converts the users input between foot candles and lux.

  3. A countdown clock calculates the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the store's anniversary party. Once the clock reaches the date of the party, the clock will show all zeros. 

  4. Data from a third-party API (Quotable API) was retrieved, and the website displays random quotes.
        * The quotes will populate every time the page is loaded. In addition, the user can click on a "New Quote" button to retrieve additional quotes.
